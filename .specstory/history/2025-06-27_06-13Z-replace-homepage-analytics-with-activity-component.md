# Replace homepage analytics with activity component (2025-06-27 06:13Z)

_**User**_

@page.tsx I'm going to replace the page analytics section on the homepage with this rings activity component.

_**Assistant**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The user wants to replace the page analytics section on the homepage with a "rings activity component". Looking at the current code, I can see there's a "Performance Analytics Section" that starts around line 343 with id "page-speed". This section contains:

1. A large section with performance metrics
2. Lighthouse performance scores
3. Gauges showing performance metrics
4. Secondary metrics grid with accessibility, SEO, and best practices
5. Bottom section explaining what the numbers mean

I need to understand what the "rings activity component" is. Looking at the project structure, I see there's a `components/kokonutui/apple-activity-card.tsx` file. This is likely the rings activity component the user is referring to, as Apple's Activity rings are a well-known UI pattern.

Let me first examine what this rings activity component looks like, then I'll replace the analytics section with it.</details></think>

I'll help you replace the page analytics section with the rings activity component. Let me first examine the rings activity component to understand how to integrate it properly.

---

Read file: components/kokonutui/apple-activity-card.tsx

---

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>I can see the Apple Activity Card component structure. It displays activity rings (like Apple's fitness rings) with different activities (MOVE, EXERCISE, STAND) showing progress towards goals. The component uses motion animations and includes circular progress indicators.

Now I need to replace the Performance Analytics Section in the homepage. Looking at the current page.tsx file, the Performance Analytics Section starts around line 343 with:

```jsx
{/* Performance Analytics Section */}
<section
  id="page-speed"
  className="w-full py-20 md:py-32 bg-gradient-to-br from-zinc-50 to-zinc-100"
>
```

And it ends around line 590 before the Solutions Section. I'll replace this entire section with the Apple Activity Card component.

First, I need to import the component, then replace the section.</details></think>

Let me also see the rest of the Apple Activity Card component to understand its complete structure:

---

Read file: components/kokonutui/apple-activity-card.tsx

---

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Now I have the complete picture of the Apple Activity Card component. It's a nice animated component that shows activity rings similar to Apple's fitness app. 

I need to:
1. Import the AppleActivityCard component
2. Replace the entire Performance Analytics Section (lines approximately 343-590) with a new section that uses the AppleActivityCard

The current Performance Analytics Section is quite large and includes multiple subsections. I'll replace it with a cleaner section that showcases the activity rings component.

Let me modify the page.tsx file to make these changes.</details></think>

Now I'll replace the Performance Analytics Section with the Apple Activity Card component. I'll need to:

1. Add the import for the AppleActivityCard component
2. Replace the entire Performance Analytics Section with a new section using the rings component

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Good, I've added the import. Now I need to replace the entire Performance Analytics Section. Looking at the file, the Performance Analytics Section starts at line 343 with:

```jsx
{/* Performance Analytics Section */}
<section
  id="page-speed"
  className="w-full py-20 md:py-32 bg-gradient-to-br from-zinc-50 to-zinc-100"
>
```

And ends around line 590 before the Solutions Section which starts with:

```jsx
{/* Solutions Section */}
<section id="solutions" className="w-full py-20 md:py-32">
```

I need to replace this entire section with a new one that uses the AppleActivityCard component.</details></think>

Now I'll replace the entire Performance Analytics Section with the Apple Activity Card component:

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Perfect! I've successfully replaced the entire Performance Analytics Section with a new Activity Rings Section that uses the AppleActivityCard component. Let me summarize what was changed:

1. **Added the import**: Added `import AppleActivityCard from "@/components/kokonutui/apple-activity-card";` to the imports

2. **Replaced the entire section**: The old Performance Analytics Section (which was quite large with multiple subsections including performance metrics, gauges, secondary metrics grid, and business impact explanations) has been replaced with a cleaner, more focused section that:
   - Changed the section ID from `page-speed` to `activity-rings`
   - Updated the badge text from "Performance Analytics" to "Activity Overview"
   - Changed the title from "We don't just build fast websites" to "Your development progress"
   - Updated the description to be more relevant to activity tracking
   - Replaced all the complex performance dashboard content with a single `AppleActivityCard` component
   - Kept the same styling and structure (background, container, etc.) for consistency

The new section is much cleaner and more focused, showcasing the beautiful animated activity rings component instead of the complex performance analytics dashboard. The component will display the activity rings with smooth animations showing progress in different categories (MOVE, EXERCISE, STAND as defined in the component).

This change significantly reduces the code complexity while introducing a visually appealing and interactive component that will draw users' attention with its smooth animations.</details></think>

Perfect! I've successfully replaced the Performance Analytics Section with the Apple Activity Card component. Here's what was changed:

## Changes Made:

1. **Added Import**: Added the import for the AppleActivityCard component at the top of the file.

2. **Replaced Entire Section**: The large Performance Analytics Section (with all its performance metrics, gauges, and business impact explanations) has been replaced with a cleaner Activity Rings Section that:
   - Uses the same overall styling and background
   - Features the animated Apple Activity Card component
   - Has updated section title and description to match the new content
   - Changed the section ID from `page-speed` to `activity-rings`

## Key Benefits:

- **Cleaner Code**: Reduced from ~250 lines of complex performance dashboard code to a simple, focused section
- **Better User Experience**: The animated activity rings will create a more engaging and visually appealing interaction
- **Modern Design**: The component matches Apple's design language with smooth animations and gradients
- **Maintained Consistency**: Kept the same section structure, spacing, and styling for seamless integration

The new section will now display beautiful animated activity rings showing progress across different metrics (MOVE, EXERCISE, STAND) with smooth motion animations that will captivate users as they scroll through your homepage.
